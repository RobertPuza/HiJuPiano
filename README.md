README
👋 Hi, I’m @RobertPuza
-I am a musician (guitar, keyboard, flute) and sound color designer. With this project, I want to help beginners and potential musicians who do not have PC knowledge and DAW knowledge. Those who work at Daw don't need me that much. I'm mainly interested in exporting a Windows, Linux, iOS and Android (if possible)  standalone apps.
👀 I’m interested in Virtual Instruments with Hise
🌱 I’m currently learning Hise
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on instruments
